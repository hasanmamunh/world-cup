				<h2>Host of the 2019 Cricket World Cup</h2>
				<p align="justify">England and Wales will play host to 2019 world cup after winning the rights over a decade ago. The hosting rights to the 2011, 2015 and 2019 world were awarded simultaneously in 2006. Initially England and Wales put in a joint bid for the 2015 world cup. However after Australia was beaten out by a joint Asian bid for the 2011 tournament they were offered the hosting rights in 2015. England and Wales were guaranteed the rights to 2019 if they agreed to withdraw their 2015 bid, which they promptly did. England were also granted the rights to the first ever T20 world cup in 2007 at the same time. The cricket tournament was originally going to be an invitational but after all twelve full and provisional members accepted the invitation the ICC granted it official status.</p>
				<h2>History of the Cricket World Cup</h2>
				<p accesskey="justify">The first world cup was held in 1975 just four years after one day cricket took the world by storm. It was the ICC’s official response to the ‘World series of cricket’ Phenomenon which was proving incredibly popular with fans. In the last 40 years the tournament has been held all over the cricketing world and has been won by teams from every corner of the globe. The tournament in 2019 will be the twelfth time the competition has been played and the fifth time it has been played in the UK. England and Wales have previously hosted in 1975, 1979, 1983 and 1999.
				</p>
				<h2>Format</h2>
                <p align="justify">In the past a variety of formats have been used but the reduced number of teams this year means that the format will be much simpler than in previous years. In 2018 there will only be one central group consisting of all 10 teams. In this group stage every nation will play each other once meaning that there will be a total of 45 group games before the finals stage. Because of this extended group phase the quarter finals have been abolished and the top 4 teams will instead progress directly to the semi-finals with the remaining 6 nations knocked out of the tournament. The winners of each respective semi will progress to the final and the winner of that match will be declared world champion.
				</p>
				<h2>Venues</h2>
				<p align="justify">While the fixture for the 2018 world cup has not yet been released. We do know some of the venues which will host the marquee games of the tournament. Lords, the spiritual home of cricket will play host to the final while The Oval will likely host the opening game. The two semi-finals according to the English Cricket Board will be played at Edgbaston and Old Trafford. The London stadium is being actively considered to host the opening ceremony and potentially some group stage fixtures. The rest of the games will likely be played across England and Wales at the grounds which meet the ICCs size and capacity requirements. A list of these stadiums is below.
				</p>
				<h2>Cricket World Cup 2019 Schedule</h2>
				<p align="justify">The schedule of the tournament is still undecided but the opening match will be on 30/05/2019 and the ending cricket world cup match will be on 15/07/2019.
